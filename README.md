# IM App Traffic Analysis Project

Welcome to the IM App Traffic Analysis Project! This project aims to delve into the world of Instant Messaging (IM) apps, exploring their traffic patterns to uncover potential security vulnerabilities and privacy concerns. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into the security landscape of these apps, ultimately contributing to a safer digital communication environment.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze data collected from various IM apps to examine their traffic behavior. We investigate whether the perceived security of these apps aligns with the actual security measures in place. By studying the patterns and interactions within the traffic, we aim to raise awareness about potential privacy risks and vulnerabilities that might compromise user data.

## Key Features

- Data Collection: Gather traffic data from a diverse range of IM apps.
- Traffic Analysis: Thoroughly analyze traffic patterns, encryption protocols, and security measures.
- Vulnerability Identification: Identify potential security vulnerabilities and privacy risks.
- Insights and Findings: Share insights and findings with the community through documentation and reports.
